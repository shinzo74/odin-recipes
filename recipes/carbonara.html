    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carbonara is an Italian pasta dish from Rome made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, in the middle of the 20th century.</p>
    <p>The dish is documented as long ago as 1839. Since the name is derived from <em>carbonaro</em> (italian for <em>charcoal burner</em> some believe the dish was first made as a hearty meal for Italian charcoal workers.</p>
